## Regenerate

Requirements: Xcode, the Android SDK with `ANDROID_HOME` set, and [AXe](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe) (`brew install cameroncooke/axe/axe`).

1. Build both apps: `ios/scripts/run.sh build` and `android/scripts/run.sh build`.
2. Capture (raw captures go to the git-ignored `raw/` folder):
   - `store/scripts/capture-ios.sh "iPhone 18 Pro Max" store/raw/iphone`
   - `store/scripts/capture-ios.sh "iPad Pro 13-inch (M5)" store/raw/ipad` (rotate the simulator to landscape when asked)
   - `store/scripts/capture-android.sh <phone serial> store/raw/android-phone` with a Pixel 10 emulator
   - `store/scripts/capture-android.sh <tablet serial> store/raw/android-tablet` with a Pixel Tablet emulator
3. Render: `store/scripts/render.sh` (or pass targets such as `iphone android-phone feature-graphic`).

Slide copy and layouts live in `composer/Sources/StoreComposer/Slides.swift`. The demo content shown in the screenshots comes from each app's demo mode (`ios/Muxy/Features/Demo`, `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/muxy/app/features/demo`).
